## Michael Gary Scott

Rating: 5 Stars
Vehicle: Chrysler Sebring
Scenario: Frontend hood damage and windshield damage after Michael hit Meredith with his car.

# Text:

While driving to work I accidently hit my coworker Meredith with my car. Everyone in the car was fine so that was all that mattered. When I got everyone up to speed on what just happened in the parking lot, I was given grief by my coworker Stanley. I told him everyone in the car was fine but he wasn't buying it and neither were my coworkers. Needless to say, I gave my car another look and saw that maybe it was worse than I thought. I had dents on my hood and a large crack in my windshield. I contacted Redline and was told it would take an estimate three days. I dropped my car off and went to brainstorming how I can repay Meredith. With three days to spare I decided on doing a 5k charity run to help find the cure for rabies in honor of Meredith. Redline finished my car in only ONE DAY. They had amazing turnaround time and I was back in my Sebring once I recovered from dehydration in the hospital due to my 5k run. They made my Sebring look better than ever. I am once again, able to listen to Brittany Spears with my sunroof down and a clear windshield with no cracks at all. They have saved me so much money that I was able to buy a $200 plasma screen tv. I love that tv I can just stare at it for hours, all thanks to Redline. I recommend them to all my friends and family. Except my coworker Toby, he is the worst. He can go pay three times the cost at another shop.

## Dwight K. Shrute

Rating: 5 Stars
Vehicle: Pontiac Trans Am
Scenario: Exterior Damage from all the stunts he has done with his cousin Mose at the farm

# Text

Let me just define my car to you in three words: amazing, fast, freedom, uncanny. This car has it all and with the style from the 80s, it is the perfect car to headbang to while listening to rock music. I have had some great times in this car and have done awesome stunts in them on my farm. My cousin Mose and I run a beet farm and on our downtime, do stunts. We have jumps, donuts in the fields, driving fast down the dirt paths, you name it. My car has taken a beating and I have been wanting to return it back to its former glory. I heard of Redline from my coworker Michael, who is the greatest regional salesman. I am an assistant to the regional manager and with that high title comes great responsibility. Which was I used Michael's suggestion to reach out to Redline and they have done an amazing job fixing my entire exterior of my car. It is a classic from the 80s and they have somehow made it look like it just came off the showroom floor. This car is worth of an assistant to the regional manager and can now ride in pride to my job every morning. Thanks Redline!

## Stanley Hudson

Rating: 5 Stars
Vehicle: Chrysler 300
Scenario: Unknown object thrown at his car while it was in the company parking lot. Came in to get the dents out and fix all the paint imperfections on his white chrysler. My wife Lita loves how my car looks

# Text:

I took my car in to Redline to see if they could fix the dents on my hood and sunroof. The damage was caused by a mysterious object that landed on my car while I had it parked in the company parking lot. Needless to say I wasn't expecting much, my day was already shot after buying a toaster for a wedding that wasn't happening so now I have two toasters. I wasn't in the mood to spend more money but my friend Cynthia recommended Redline. The Redline employees recommended me the paint protection film and the exterior package to get all the paint imperfections and all the dents out. The turnaround time was quick and I was able to relax and do my crossword puzzle in peace. The money I saved with Redline eased the frustration of buying a second toaster. I plan to use that money to take my wife out for the weekend to celebrate in my new showroom ready car.

## Pamela Beesly

Scenario: Frontend damage from Nellie driving the car into the bushes at the company parking lot

# Text:

After trying to teach my coworker, Nellie how to drive, I ended up with damage to my front-end. My friend Nellie was all over the place during our driving session and ended up damaging my front-end by driving into the bushes and wall after trying to park the car. To top it off, we also had also gotten curb rash on our rims when Nellie was too preoccupied while trying to eat a salad. I like my coworker, but that was the last time I let her drive my car. I didn't have a lot of money to spare on an expensive detailer so I looked around and came across the Redline website. They had an option to get a quote via email and I figured I would give it a go. I submitted my email and within five minutes, Redline reached out to me with a few quick questions on my car and gave me a quote on the job that was fair. I was able to drop my car off for a few hours and when I received it back, the front of my car looked amazing. They were able to repair curb rash on my wheels and they look brand new. The whole process was quick and painless for someone who is clueless with cars. They advertised a quick email response in minutes and they delivered. I would give them 6 stars if I could. I recommend Redline to everyone in need of a professional detailing car company. Thanks again Redline!

## Meredith Palmer

Vehicle: Ford Aerostar Minivan
Scenario: Came in to get panel restored from deep damage caused by parking in a tight spot. Ended up scrapping the entire driver's side panel trying to fit in the compact spot.

# Text:

After badly damaging my driver's side panels trying to park my minivan into a compact spot, I came to Redline. By some miracle, the technicians at Redline were able to repair the damage and save me a lot of money. I had enough money to go buy my son groceries and celebrate the rest of the night. If it wasn't for Redline, I'm not sure what we would eat that night, so I just wanted to say thank you Redline! To top it all off, the employees went above and beyond and did an interior clean. I had a lot of trash inside my car like wrappers and empty bottles. They cleaned everything out and did a free vacuum and seat shampooing on the house. The last time I got something for free was outback steaks and that was years ago! No one gives things out for free and for Redline employees to take the time to do something on the house means a lot! I recommend Redline to everyone and will be a customer for life.

## Kevin Malone

Vehicle: Honda CR-V
Scenario: Interior Damage from spilled homemade chili while transporting it to The Office. He had to drive back home to get another suit and caused further damage by covering the driver's side seat with chili.

# Text:

After my mechanic wasn't able to help me clean my seats in my car, I took it in to Redline. Let me fill you in on the backstory as you won't believe me if I didn't. I made my famous "Kevin Malone Homemade Chili" the night before work to share with my coworkers at the office. The secret to a great chili is to undercook the onions. Sorry, I am getting off track, where was I? Oh yeah, everything was good, until I got off the elvator on my floor at work. I ended up spilling the whole pot of chili on the office floor by the reception desk. I panicked and tried to clean up the chili the best I could but I accidently slipped in the chili trying to clean it up before everyone showed up. I didn't have backup clothes in my car, so I had to drive back home in my dirty suit covered in chili. I got chili all over my seats and needed help quick so I went to my mechanic. After my mechanic wasn't able to help, Redline was my last hope. The employees at Redline were friendly and recommended the interior package. Redline was able to get rid of the chili stains out of my seats. I recommend Redline to everyone and will be coming back to them again if I take another spill. When me mechanic says its a no-go, I will go to Redline. Thanks Redline!
